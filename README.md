# Project-Altius
A game, built from the ground up to have multiplayer support.
The game is built on lidgren - a c# internet framework,  
where I adjusted the default peer to peer to work with a client server architecture.

# So whats this game about
Currently, nothing, Originally it was going to be a dungeon crawler where you delve deeper into the dungeon ,  
but that doesn't work very well in client server,  
so I'm re-evaluating my ideas. A tactical rpg seems cool.

# Then whats the point if there isn't even a game yet?
Currently many components are in place (the basic networking) and all of these are easily re-usable in other projects.  
In a few minutes I could download the repo and take out the two networking classes and shove them into some other project.

# Where did the name come from
According to google translate altius was latin for deeper,so for a dungeon delving game it suited,  
this is wrong obviously, altius is latin for higher, but the name stuck and is a good general codename for a game in my eyes.
The name will eventually change(maybe) to something better.
